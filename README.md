# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection


This is a binary classification problem using a credit card fraud detection dataset. This is a supervised machine learning problem with twenty-eight input variables and one output variable. There are 492 fraudulant transactions of 284,807 transactions.

The input variables are the principal components obtained via PCA and more information could not be provided in order to preserve the privacy of the customers. Time and transaction amound are the only variables not obtained via PCA.

My usual route for a machine learning project is as follows:

Pre-processing Data: Check size, descriptive stats, clean data, fill missing values, etc...
Data Visualizations
Feature Engineering
Create Training/Testing Datasets
Build and score models by trainning on the training dataset
Model prediction and scoring using test data
This might change because PCA has already been applied to the data thus data mining and data discovery techniques might not be worthwhile as we do have information regarding the importance of our variables.
